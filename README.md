# Keylogger_capture_keyStrokes_ibm_aicte_internship
The purpose of this application is to keep tracks on every key that is typed through the keyboard and  send it to the admin through the mail server in the time set or given. It provides confidentiality as  well as data recovery to all the IT infrastructures in need.
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Operating system : Windows and Linux specified
RAM : 512MB (minimum requirement)
Hard Disk : 1GB working space (minimum requirement)
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Languages : Python
Tools : PyCharm, Python 3.8.0
Technology : Advanced programming using Python

In many companies now-a-days data security and data recovery is the most important factor. 
So there are many cases where data recovery is required. For these kinds of problems keylogger is 
one of the best solutions which is often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing.
Keyboard capturing is the action of recording the keys stroke on a keyboard, typically covertly, so 
that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Using 
keylogger application users can retrieve data when working file is damaged due to several reasons 
like loss of power etc. 
This is a surveillance application used to track the users which logs keystrokes; uses log files to 
retrieve information. Using this application we can recall forgotten email or URL. In this keylogger 
project, whenever the user types something through the keyboard, the keystrokes are captured and 
mailed to the mail id of admin without the knowledge of the user within the time set. 
OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this application is to keep tracks on every key that is typed through the keyboard 


The main objective of this document is to illustrate the requirements of the project Keylogger. Nowa-days IT business infrastructures are mostly in need of the cyber security factor that is Computer 
Forensics. Keyloggers can effectively assist a computer forensics analyst in the examination of 
digital media.
Keystroke loggers are available in software and hardware form, and are used to capture and compile 
a record of all typed keys. The information gathered from a keystroke logger can be saved on the 
system as a hidden file, or emailed to the forensic analyst or the Administrator. Generic keystroke 
loggers typically record the keystrokes associated with the keyboard typing. Advanced keystroke 
loggers have many additional features. Our project keylogger has the following features;
 Monitors Keystrokes
 Sends mail to the Admin’s mail Id
 Logs keystrokes including special keys
Keyloggers have the advantage of collecting information before it is encrypted; thus making a 
forensic analyst’s job easier. Most keyloggers show no signs of any intrusion within the system 
allowing for them to gain typed information without anyone having knowledge of its actions except 
the user who use it. Keyloggers incorporate a wide array of cyber security issues and provide a 
practical approach to understand topics such as attacker goals, varieties of malware and their 
implementation, the role of malware in infecting and how stealth is archived in an infected system.
